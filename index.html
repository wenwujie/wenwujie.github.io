<h4><strong>About me</strong></h4>

<p>Wujie Wen is an associate professor in the department of <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ece" >Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://www1.lehigh.edu/">Lehigh University</a>. He received his Ph.D. from University of Pittsburgh in 2015, under the supervision of Dr. <a target="_blank" href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen">Yiran Chen </a> (Now in Duke Univerity). He earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University and Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2010, respectively. He was an assistant professor in the ECE department of Florida International University, Miami, FL, during 2015-2019. Before joining the academy, he also worked with AMD and Broadcom for various engineer and intern positions. His research interests include deep learning hardware acceleration/security and privacy/application, neuromorphic computing, electronic design automation (EDA), and circuit-architecture design for emerging memory technologies etc. His works have been published widely across venues in EDA, machine learning/AI etc., including DAC, ICCAD, DATE, MICRO, HPCA, ICPP, HOST, S &P (Oakland), USENIX Security, ACSAC, CVPR, NIPs, ECCV, AAAI etc. Dr. Wen is the associate editor of Neurocomputing and serves/served as the General Chair of ISVLSI 2019 (Miami), Technical Program Chair of ISVLSI 2018 (Hong Kong), as well as program committee for many conferences such as DAC, ICCAD, DATE, ASP-DAC etc. He received best paper nominations from ICCAD2018, ASP-DAC2018, DATE2016 and DAC2014. He was also the recipient of the 49th DAC A. Richard Newton Graduate Scholarship--the most prestigious Ph.D. scholarship (one awardee per year) in EDA society, 2014 Bronze Medal of ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) student research competition (SRC) in ICCAD, and 2015 DAC Ph.D. forum best poster presentation. He is a recipent of NSF Faulty Early Career Award. His research projects are currently sponsored by NSF, AFRL and the Florida Center for Cybersecurity etc. </p>
